# Nomad
A 68HC000 based microcomputer using only discrete parts, with enough features to enable the board to function like a bad microcontroller.

- Clocked at 12MHz (functions up to ~14MHz)
- 128K SRAM, 128K EEPROM
- MK68901 Multi-Function Peripheral chip (includes a 115200 baud UART, 4 programmable timers, and an 8-bit I/O port)
- Expansion breakout

EEPROM flashing is done by inserting both chips into an adapter board and flashing assembled binaries with a Python script.

The name "Nomad" was chosen because the board contains all one needs in order to have a fully functional 68000 system anywhere the board goes. And I thought it sounded cool.

This project is currently shelved because my 68000 broke and I don't really want to buy another one without thinking of some sort of application for this thing.

## Details
### Overview
  The Nomad board is a 68000/68010 compatible microcomputer with 128K of SRAM and 128K of EEPROM memory, with the EEPROM being in a convenient PLCC socket for repeated removal.  The Nomad board includes a MK68901 peripheral chip to enable microcontroller-like functionality, including 4 timers, a buffered 115200 baud 8N1 UART interface, and an 8-bit I/O port, all with processor interrupt capabilities.  The board can be clocked anywhere from 8MHz (the minimum speed of the processor) to somewhere around 14MHz (max speed of the MK peripheral).

  The bootloader is currently not capable of self-updating, although this will be available in the future.  Due to the 68000 architecture, this means that the interrupt vector table is not modifiable without re-flashing the bootloader.  This can also be fixed by using a 68010, which can move the vector table into RAM if modification is required.

  On the software side, a couple programs have been developed in order to speed assembly development:
 - The makefile itself, which assembles source code using binutils.  Note that there is a makefile for compiling C and C++ programs, but support for this is incomplete.
 - `eeprom_interface`, an Arduino program that takes in commands and data over the serial port and flashes the EEPROM chip connected with the appropriate data.  This program can also verify the EEPROM identification information and read code from the EEPROM into a binary on the host computer for later use.
 - `split`, a tool that splits the final binary into and even and odd binaries, suitable for upload onto the two EEPROM chips in the Nomad board
 - `eeprom_config`, a host tool that interfaces with the Arduino program listed above, allowing the user to specify only an action, a binary, and the Arduino's location and have the code be automatically uploaded to the EEPROM chip connected.
 - `flash`, a (broken) bash script that tries to automate the whole thing
 - `upload`, a Python program that interfaces with the Nomad bootloader directly.  Script is likely to change as the bootloader gets written.

### Design goals
1. Fast.  Or at least as fast as the hardware will reliably support.
2. Simple.  Easy to program for, but still capable of doing something interesting.
3. Extensible.  The board should contain enough to do something fun out of the box, but not enough that it hinders future expansion.
4. Compact.  I really don't like massive 2-layer boards, so this board is compact.

### Setup
GNU binutils needs to be in the PATH variable, and built for [m68k-elf](https://daveho.github.io/2012/10/26/m68k-elf-cross-compiler.html).  Version 2.31 has been tested, but most other versions of binutils should work as well.

### Usage
Sample test binary upload:
```
$ make test # build the test executable, view assembly to make sure everything is right
$ ./split test.bin # splits the test.bin binary into high and low binaries
$ ./eeprom_config --action write --device /dev/ttyUSB0 --binary test.bin.msb # write each eeprom chip, insert into board
$ ./eeprom_config --action write --device /dev/ttyUSB0 --binary test.bin.lsb
```
- `make test`: assembles the src/test/test.S file and dumps assembly
- `make boot`: assembles the bootloader
- `make app`: assembles an application that sits after the bootloader
- `make clean`: clean binaries out

### Memory map
```
0x00000 ðŸ ‚ 0x1FFFF: EEPROM
	0x000 ðŸ ‚ 0x400: EVT
	0x400 ðŸ ‚ 0x1FFFF: Bootloader and lib code - write-protected as this (will) set up the MMU.
0x20000 ðŸ ‚ 0x3FFFF: "common" SRAM - accessible to all programs (put application code here)
	0x3FC00 ðŸ ‚ 0x3FFFF: Program data (1024 bytes)
		0x3FC00 ðŸ ‚ 0x3FC3F: MFP UART buffer (64 bytes)
		0x3FC40 ðŸ ‚ 0x3FCFF: Reserved kernel space (used for EEPROM updates)
0x40000 ðŸ ‚ 0x400FF?: MFP
```

calling convention:
 - everything is callee-saved except for a0, a1, d0, and d1
 - pass everything on the stack as a long, eliminates alignment issues and we have the space for it

## Revision 1
Status: ordered, assembled, and partially tested.

 - Things that were broken:
	 - Bought a tantulum cap instead of an electrolytic one, didn't notice, and it blew on me
	 - RX buffering was inverted, luckily caught it before it broke anything
	 - Only one inverting buffer was used, so all of the TX and RX signals are inverted.
	 - Some of the silkscreens for the expansion IO were off a little, but I knew about that
	 - RC values for reset were wrong because I didn't have anything pulling current from it in the simulation
	 - 10uF caps have the wrong footprint
	 - Mounting holes were too small
	 - Software Data Protection on the EEPROMs needed to be turned off, but that isn't a huge concern and working around SDP is really annoying with current architecture
	 - MFP DTACK signal is grounded all the time, but MFP still accepts reads and writes.  Not a huge issue since grounded DTACK makes sense from a logical point of view
	 - Cold solder joint on 4AN1 prevented the MFP from being triggered

 - Things that worked:
   - CPU executed code in a loop, RAM word access seemed to be working okay
   - MFP can read data values off the bus and manipulate the IO ports just fine
   - MFP can print out characters encoded in instruction literals
   - MFP can echo characters off the UART

 - Measurements:
   - Board draws ~270mA when executing instructions, and ~230mA when in reset, but these values might be wrong because of the above bug with the power supply circuitry.
   - At 14MHz (highest clock frequency available that allows for the MFP to function), the minimum MFP I/O switch time is 10us (100kHz).  High-speed I/O this is not.

## Revision 2
Status: schematic created, but revisions have not been checked either by hand or by computer

## TODOs
 - Do housekeeping such as zeroing out .bss section because no OS will do it for us
   - cannot load anything into SRAM at assemble time, all has to be done by bootloader.
 - Get the board clocked at 16 MHz (12 - 12.5 right now because anything faster will cause the MFP to not work)
 - put some artwork or something cool on the bottom side if it doesn't add too much to the cost of the board
 - make it so the bootloader program contains a lot of test code, and the board could read an unimplemented area of memory to determine what tests to run.
 - decide how much stuff I want to write in C vs assembly
 - write a linker script and assembly file containing _start, use it with GCC (can't use the standard _start since I have special requirements as to the memory layout)
 - write code in C, test on an x64 machine
 - port newlib to the board, but before all that I have to order a rev 2 with all the issues fixed.
 - finish vim extension for m68k asm

### Bad ideas
 - letting the MMU handle illegal accesses to low 128K of memory - MMU has to sit between processor and memory
 - remove pullup on AS - there to prevent spurious memory acceses once bus master is done and CPU has not relinquished control of the bus yet
 - having the processor wait for the UART host to transmit a binary - will hang if the board should be booting from a stored EEPROM program
 - supervisor access only to EEPROM - prevents user from using hardware libs, initial supervisor -> user jump is awkward at best
 - having MFP drive IRQ lines directly - if a priority level 2 interrupt and level 1 interrupt fire at the same time, the processor will register a level 3 interrupt.

### Maybe ideas
 - having an MMU board at all - 68451 chip is kinda hard to find on eBay and pretty expensive too, couldn't find a PLCC package for it

## Future ideas
 - make a wall clock using cool 7-seg displays
 - air quality measurement using some sort of gas sensor
 - add a GSM module or something - usually UART based!
 - some sort of laser thing - laser servo application!
 - write some sort of graphics application or game
   - controlling the screen over UART isn't a good idea, and the maximum data transfer speed over the IO lines is pretty slow
 - use an FPGA board to perform DMA on the memory (like the Apple Macintosh)
   - DMA would have to work correctly for this to function properly, and 68000 DMA chips are really hard to find
   - write an I2C driver that bit-bangs data off the I/O port to something like an SSD1306
     - simple, and doesn't require special hardware.
     - might be hard to make this fast enough for a fun game
     - reviewing OpenGL code before doing this would be helpful for knowing the features I need if 3D graphics are to be included
     - screen options are I2C, a simple VGA adapter, or a full on HDMI port
 - User board
   - could literally just be some switches and (buffered) LEDs
   - switches can be pulled high or low, so a read to unimplemented memory can read in values (drive DTACK high until done)
   - could also be CPLD-based
     - gives me a chance to put something CPLD-based in here
     - JTAG experience
     - add features like DTACK/BERR generation
     - add IO that can actually source current
 - Audio board
   - could initially just be an op-amp or two connected to a couple lines on the MFP
   - probably want a seperate power supply for this to avoid noise on the power lines?
   - could also add seperate voices - if I were to do this it would require external hardware, MFP is pretty limited
 - Floating point arithmetic
   - don't use the 68k floating point hardware - requires a 68020 or greater for coprocessor support
   - hardware support without the 68020 is kinda dumb
 - Use a later version of the 68000 architecture.
   - Having a MMU and a FPU on-chip would be nice
   - Should be able to clock it at the same frequencies, which means no high-speed circuit design.
     - If I go all the way up to the 68040/68060, I get nice features like JTAG and integrated FPU and MMUs
     - Need to worry about heat sink stuff, kinda like a real computer
     - At this point it would be easier to design a raspi clone, which is hard to do.
 - Replace the hard glue logic with a CPLD
   - Should have done this originally, a lot easier to work with and I would have learned way more
   - Custom hardware for peripherals, because finding cheap 68000-compatible peripheral chips is annoying
   - If glue logic is required, use HCT family instead of LS family. Easier to interface with.
 - More interface options
   - SPI using the MFP I/O pins
     - slow, but easier to implement
   - External device grabs host memory using DMA (FPGA or CPLD with microcontroller)
     - significantly faster
     - harder to design
     - requires host board modification since the DMA functionality is broken currently
       - Dual-ported RAM
         - a good idea for video stuff, especially 3D applications
   - FIFO chips
     - good for ingesting lots of fast data
     - could be part of a high-speed 8-bit parallel bus - clocked way higher than the processor itself?
       - if using the AM7202A chip lying around, I could use the 9th bit to do hardware parity checking
 - Paper tape reader (for fun)
   - Use a CPLD for interfacing with the board
   - Might teach me something about proper motor control
   - Uses either a cardboard or LEGO structure to read in holes punched into the tape
   - Once that is done, use a solenoid motor to possibly punch holes in a new tape and output it

### Shelved
 - BASIC interpreter
   - not interested in this since I don't like BASIC and I'm not running any kind of legacy software
 - Multi-tasking operating system
   - really hard to do well and other projects have great existing solutions already
